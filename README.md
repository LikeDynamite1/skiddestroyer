what this script do?

i named the script "string viruses" this script put some textlabels with string text on the client screen
and make him say they are a Exploiter
maybe it causes a few epileptic attacks but nothing major!
remove the Character of the client and his topbarapp to stop any move
It also prints the word "string" many times in the Roblox console
a bit of lag
